## Code contributions

### Fork

Fork the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/bucharest-gold/szero)
and check out your copy locally.

```
git clone git@github.com:username/szero.git
cd szero
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bucharest-gold/szero.git
```

### Branch

Create a feature branch and start hacking:

```
git checkout -b my-contrib-branch
```

### Commit messages

Writing good commit logs is important. A commit log should describe what
changed and why. Follow these guidelines when writing one:

1. The first line should be 50 characters or less and contain a short
   description of the change.
2. Keep the second line blank.
3. Wrap all other lines at 72 columns.

Example of commit message:

```
fix a bug with download url.

The download url was not using https.
Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
being fixed, etc. etc.

The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
72 characters or so. That way `git log` will show things
nicely even when it is indented.
```

### Rebase to keep updated.

Use `git rebase` to sync your work from time to time.

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

### Development cycle

Bug fixes and features should come with tests.
The tests are on `test` directory.

```
make
```

### Push

git push origin my-contrib-branch
```
